## SSA Toshi

### What is this?

This is a fairly primitive prototype to showcase how [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) smart contracts might be utilized to make a dent in the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) problem. This research led to the creation and launch of [TruSat](https://trusat.org).

See the `KuiperDatabase.sol` "smart contract" in the `contracts` directory. It was deployed to and still lives on the `Rinkeby` Ethereum test-net.
